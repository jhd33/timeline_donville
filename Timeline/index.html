		This timeline is not a detailed chronology, but a reflective look back at the moments that have shaped the history of the Toronto Raptors. As a city, Toronto has undergone a significant sporting transformation over the past two decades, transitioning from a market where hockey was the by far the biggest show in town, to one where hockey and basketball compete. The rise of Canadian basketball has coincided both with the rise of the Raptors, and the continual demographic changes that have shaped Toronto as a city and a sports market. As someone who has grown up in the Greater Toronto Area and was lucky enough to attend some of the playoff games, the Raptors postseason run was the greatest moment or series of moments I have ever had as a sports fan. I will never forget those few weeks.
